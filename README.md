# GasPropertyCalc_usingAGA8DC

This C# code implements the AGA8 detail characterisation or molar composition analysis method of calculating natural gas properties based on the EN ISO 12213-2 2005 standard.

The implementation contains an interface IGasProperty with a method for calculating gas density and a method for calculating the gas compressibility factor.
